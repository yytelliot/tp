## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Java 17

OnlyTutors requires **Java 17** (or above). Follow the instructions for your operating system:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: How to check if Java is already installed:**

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:
```
java -version
```
If the output shows `java version "17"` or higher, skip to [Step 2](#step-2-download-onlytutors). Otherwise, install Java below.

</div>

**Windows:**
1. Go to [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).
2. Under the **Windows** tab, download the **x64 Installer** (`.exe` file).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. After installation, open Command Prompt and run `java -version` to verify.

**macOS:**
> Follow the precise JDK 17 installation guide for Mac [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
> Using the wrong JDK version on macOS can cause display issues with the GUI — use the exact version prescribed.

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```
2. Verify with `java -version`.

---

### Step 2: Download OnlyTutors

1. Go to the [OnlyTutors Releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/releases).
2. Find the **latest release** at the top of the list.
3. Under **Assets**, click `onlytutors.jar` to download it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Do not rename the `.jar` file. Keep it as `onlytutors.jar` to match the run command.
</div>

---

### Step 3: Set Up a Home Folder

Create a dedicated folder for OnlyTutors (e.g., `OnlyTutors` on your Desktop). Move the downloaded `onlytutors.jar` into that folder.

This folder will become the **home folder** — OnlyTutors will store all your data here in a `data/` subfolder automatically.

---

### Step 4: Launch OnlyTutors

Open a terminal and navigate to your home folder, then run the app:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\OnlyTutors
java -jar onlytutors.jar
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\OnlyTutors
java -jar onlytutors.jar
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```
cd ~/Desktop/OnlyTutors
java -jar onlytutors.jar
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Alternative: Double-click to launch**

On most systems you can double-click `onlytutors.jar` to launch OnlyTutors directly. However, using the terminal is recommended so you can see error messages if something goes wrong.

</div>

A GUI similar to the screenshot below should appear within a few seconds. The app starts with sample data to help you explore its features.

Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for the full details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `[n/NAME]` means the `n/NAME` parameter can be omitted.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/math`, `t/math t/primary3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a new student to OnlyTutors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS d/DAY st/START_TIME et/END_TIME r/RATE`
</div>

* All fields are required.
* Tags cannot be added during the `add` command. Use [`tag add`](#adding-tags-to-a-student-tag-add) after adding the student.
* New students are marked as **Unpaid** by default.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**
OnlyTutors does not allow duplicate students. Two students are considered duplicates if they have the **same name**
(case-insensitive) **and** the **same phone number**.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Rationale for duplicate detection:**

OnlyTutors considers two contacts duplicates if they have the **same name (case-insensitive)** and **same phone number**.

This design is chosen because:

* Names alone are not unique (e.g. many students may share the same name)
* Phone numbers alone are not reliable (e.g. siblings may share a parent’s number)
* Combining both provides a practical and reliable identifier for tutors

**Additionally:**

* Duplicate detection is case-insensitive (e.g. `john doe` = `John Doe`)
* Names are displayed exactly as entered to preserve user formatting

</div>

**Examples:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 d/Monday st/15:00 et/17:00 r/50` | Adds student John Doe with a Monday 3–5pm lesson at $50/lesson |
| `add n/Alice Tan p/81234567 e/alice@example.com a/Blk 30 Geylang St 29, #06-40 d/Wednesday st/10:00 et/12:00 r/60` | Adds student Alice Tan with a Wednesday 10am–12pm lesson at $60/lesson |

**Expected output** (on success):
> `New contact added: John Doe; Phone: 98765432; Email: johnd@example.com; Address: 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25; Day: MONDAY; Start Time: 15:00; End Time: 17:00; Rate: 50; Tags:`

**Expected output** (on fail):
> `Names should contain only English characters, with words separated by a single space or '/', e.g. 'Tan Ah Kow' or 'Raj S/O Kumar'. Names must not start or end with a space or '/', and must not contain consecutive spaces or '/' characters`

### ⚠️ Common mistakes when adding a student

| Mistake             | Why it fails                                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `r/$40`             | Symbols are not allowed; rate must be a number   |
| `r/40.0`            | Decimals are not allowed; must be a whole number |
| `r/9000`            | Hourly rate exceeds the maximum cap of 5000                                                 |
| `n/John123`         | Name cannot contain numbers                      |
| `n/`                | Name cannot be empty                             |
| `p/12345678`        | Must start with 6, 8, or 9                       |
| `d/Mon`             | Must use full day name (e.g. Monday)             |
| `st/3pm`            | Must use 24-hour format (e.g. 15:00)             |
| `et/14:00 st/15:00` | End time must be after start time                |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes on Tuition Rate

* Hourly Basis: The rate r/ represents the amount charged per hour.
* Data Normalization: Leading zeros will be automatically removed (e.g., r/0050 will be saved as 50).
* Validation: To prevent typos, the app caps the rate at 5000.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Listing all students: `list`

Shows a list of all students in OnlyTutors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**Format:** `list`
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use `list` after a [`find`](#finding-students-by-name-find) command to return to the full student list.
</div>

**Expected output:**
> `Listed all persons`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Editing a student: `edit`

Edits the details of an existing student in OnlyTutors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**Format:** `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/DAY] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [r/RATE] [t/TAG]…​`
</div>

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX` (a positive integer: 1, 2, 3, …).
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

**Editing Tags:**
* When editing tags with `t/`, existing tags are **replaced entirely**.
* Remove all tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it (not true for other fields since they must be nonempty).
* Note the same rules for adding a person apply here, i.e. person name must contain only alphabets, end time must be strictly after start time and so on.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**
Editing tags with the `edit` command **replaces all existing tags**. If a student has tags `math` and `primary3`, running `edit 1 t/science` will result in only the `science` tag remaining.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
To add tags without replacing, use [`tag add`](#adding-tags-to-a-student-tag-add) instead.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
</div>

**Examples:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` | Changes the phone and email of the 1st student |
| `edit 2 n/Betsy Crowe t/` | Changes the name of the 2nd student and clears all tags |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]…​`
</div>

* The search is **case-insensitive**. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only the **name** is searched.
* Only **full words** are matched. e.g. `Han` will **not** match `Hans`.
* Students matching **at least one** keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

**Examples:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `find John` | Returns `john` and `John Doe` |
| `find alex david` | Returns `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li` |

**Expected output:**

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deleting a student: `delete`

Deletes the specified student from OnlyTutors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**Format:** `delete INDEX [INDEX]…​`
</div>

* Deletes the student(s) at the specified `INDEX`(es).
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** (1, 2, 3, …).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can delete multiple students at once by specifying multiple indices. e.g. `delete 1 3 7` deletes the 1st, 3rd, and 7th students.

* If any student is already marked as paid, the command will fail with: `This student has already been marked as paid.`

The payment status is displayed on each student's card as a **Paid** or **Unpaid** label next to the rate.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can mark multiple students as paid at once by specifying multiple indices. e.g. `mark 1 2 3` marks the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd students as paid.
</div>

**Examples:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `mark 1` | Marks the 1st student as paid |
| `mark 1 2 3` | Marks the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd students as paid |
| `find John` then `mark 1` | Marks the 1st student in the `find` results as paid |

**Expected output** (on success):
> `Marked student as paid: John Doe; Phone: ...`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Marking a student as unpaid: `unmark`

Marks a student's payment status as **Unpaid**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**Format:** `unmark INDEX [INDEX]…​`
</div>

* Marks the student(s) at the specified `INDEX`(es) as unpaid.
* The index **must be a positive integer** (1, 2, 3, …).
* If any student is already marked as unpaid, the command will fail with: `This student has already been marked as unpaid.`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can unmark multiple students at once by specifying multiple indices. e.g. `unmark 1 2 3` marks the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd students as unpaid. Use this at the start of a new payment cycle to reset payment statuses. See also: [`mark`](#marking-a-student-as-paid-mark).
</div>

**Examples:**

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `unmark 1` | Marks the 1st student as unpaid |

### Saving the data

OnlyTutors data is saved to the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Editing the data file

OnlyTutors data is saved automatically as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/onlytutors.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, OnlyTutors may discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. It is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it. Furthermore, certain edits can cause OnlyTutors to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install OnlyTutors on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous OnlyTutors home folder.

**Q**: Can I add tags when adding a new student?<br>
**A**: No. Tags must be added after the student is created using the [`tag add`](#adding-tags-to-a-student-tag-add) command.

**Q**: How do I change a student's lesson day or time?<br>
**A**: Use the [`edit`](#editing-a-student-edit) command. For example, `edit 1 d/Tuesday st/10:00 et/12:00` changes the 1st student's lesson to Tuesday, 10:00–12:00.

**Q**: What happens if I add a student with the same name and phone number as an existing student?<br>
**A**: OnlyTutors will reject the duplicate and display an error message. Two students are considered duplicates if they share the same name (case-insensitive) and the same phone number.

**Q**: Can I track multiple lessons for the same student?<br>
**A**: Currently, each student can only have one lesson day and time. Support for multiple lessons is planned for a future version.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**: If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.
